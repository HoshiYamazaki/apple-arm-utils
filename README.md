# Apple ARM utils

This repo contains various utilities that are neccessary for me
when I develop software in various languages, mainly while using Python
on Apple Silicon chips.

Tested on: Mac Mini 2020 M1 version

### Note:
Remember you need to set python version using pyenv global (for the best compatibility with Xapian use 3.6 for now).
